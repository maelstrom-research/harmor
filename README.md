Dataset Harmonization Utils
===========================

Toolbox for implementing and documenting the harmonization of datasets:

* Shortcut functions for retrieving a [Opal](https://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/) table as a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) and saving a tibble as a Opal table using [opalr](https://github.com/obiba/opalr),
* Helper functions for applying annotations to tibble's columns,
* Generator of harmonization book: populate content of a [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) site. See [harmobook-demo](https://github.com/maelstrom-research/harmobook-demo) project for starting a new R markdown-based harmonization site. 

See usage [examples](https://github.com/maelstrom-research/harmor/tree/master/inst/examples).
